# Efficient column selection algorithms for kernel approximation, CUR decomposition, and inverse Laplacian rank reduction in C++

This repository contains the production code used for *Column and row subset selection using nuclear scores: theory and applications for Nystrom approximation, CUR decomposition, and graph Laplacian reduction* by Mark Fornace and Michael Lindsey (arXiv, 2024). It will be updated soon with documentation and usage examples. Stay tuned!
